## Notes

It took me a while to figure out how the constraints and the views interact with each other to create a succesful spring animation. Through Stack Overflow, I learned that I could change the priorities of an object's constraints to make it collaborate with the planned animation. In addition, though trials and errors, I understood more about manipulating a view to create a dynamic UI.
